## Building web & mobile apps

- Meteor allows you to use the same code on server- and clientside
- The default platform is web, but other platforms can be added:
```
meteor add-platform android
meteor add-platform ios
```
- Meteor packages are isomorphic (they might run on the web, on a mobile device or on the server)
